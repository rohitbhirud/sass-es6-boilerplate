    Responsive Rules Using MQ-SASS

******************************************/
// To enable support for browsers that do not support @media queries,
// (IE <= 8, Firefox <= 3, Opera <= 9) set $mq-responsive to false
// Create a separate stylesheet served exclusively to these browsers,
// meaning @media queries will be rasterized, relying on the cascade itself
$mq-responsive: true;

// Name your breakpoints in a way that creates a ubiquitous language
// across team members. It will improve communication between
// stakeholders, designers, developers, and testers.
$mq-breakpoints: (
  small: 350px,
  mobile: 500px,
  mini: 769px,
  pro: 1025px,
  desktop: 1280px,
  wide: 1300px,

  // Tweakpoints
  desktopAd: 810px,
  mobileLandscape: 480px,
);

// Define the breakpoint from the $mq-breakpoints list that should
// be used as the target width when outputting a static stylesheet
// (when $mq-responsive is set to 'false').
$mq-static-breakpoint: desktop;

// If you want to display the currently active breakpoint in the top
// right corner of your site during development, add the breakpoints
// to this list, ordered by width. For example: (mobile, tablet, desktop).
$mq-show-breakpoints: (mobile, mini, pro, desktop, wide);
